##To Java or C or C++ oh my!


I have been a web centric developer my entire career. Javascript, CSS, Html, PHP,
MYSQL, etc, have been my home. Making a switch to another language is exciting and
intimidating. I look forward to the new opportunities that are in my future. I have
played around in C, Java, C#, but never did anything with it. This also might be
the end of my freelancing career. Which I have mixed feelings about. I love freelancing!
Stability does sound nice. So does employee benefits.
